        When you click on a box, a
        number that identifies how many mines there are
        around. Be careful because if you click on
        a square that has a hidden mine,
        you will lose. If you believe or are certain
        that there is a mine, long click on
        the box to mark it. Don\'t click
        long in a square where there is no mine
        because you will lose. You win once you have
        found all the mines.
